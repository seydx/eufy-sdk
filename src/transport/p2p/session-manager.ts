/**
 * P2P session lifecycle manager — owns the {@link P2PSession} registry and decides WHEN a session is
 * open. It exists to stop battery-powered cameras draining: a persistent P2P session runs a
 * 5 s PING heartbeat forever (keeping the device awake), so instead of opening every station eagerly
 * and holding it open, this opens a station's session **on demand** (first command / stream / pre-warm)
 * and **auto-closes** it after an idle window whose length depends on the station's power tier.
 *
 * Pure transport: it knows nothing about capabilities or events. The power tier per station
 * (`wired` = mains HomeBase / plugged camera → persistent; `battery` = standalone battery cam → short
 * idle-detach) is injected as plain data via {@link SessionManagerOpts.poweredFor} by the facade, so
 * `model/` is never imported here (the decorrelation invariant).
 *
 * Refcount model — ONE counter per station, shared by every "reason to stay connected": a live stream
 * retains it while any viewer is attached; a control command and a speculative pre-warm (e.g. a doorbell
 * ring) each take a **hold**, which retains it and then releases itself when its timer expires. When the
 * counter hits zero the idle timer arms; a new retain cancels it. `wired` stations use an infinite
 * window (never auto-close); `battery` stations a short one.
 *
 * A hold is distinguished from an attached viewer only for {@link SessionManager.resetWhenUnused},
 * which may close through expiring holds but must wait for a real viewer.
