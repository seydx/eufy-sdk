/**
 * Bounded, identity-free live-startup diagnostics.
 *
 * A live start spans two modules — the session issues the media command and reassembles datagrams, the
 * stream turns accepted frames into access units — so the message and its phase vocabulary have one owner
 * here rather than a literal repeated at each call site. A caller reads these to tell one startup outcome
 * from another, and matches on {@link LIVE_TRACE_MESSAGE} plus a {@link LiveTrace} phase to do it.
 *
 * Every field is a fixed label, a boolean, a data-type id, or a sign code. No serial, P2P identifier,
 * address, account id, key material, or media byte is carried, so the records are safe in a host's log.
 *
 * @module p2p/live-trace
