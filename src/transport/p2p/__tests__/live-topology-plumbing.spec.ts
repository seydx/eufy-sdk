/**
 * The live leg must hand `LiveStream` the resolved channel AND the topology, because together they are
 * what arms the per-camera frame filter.
 *
 * `LiveStream` sets its `mediaChannel` — the tag inbound media must match — only when BOTH
 * `homeBaseAttached` is true and `channel` is defined. Lose either on the way from `resolveSession` to
 * the constructor and the filter silently disarms: every handle on the session then takes every
 * camera's frames, and a caller asking for one camera is handed another's picture with no error and no
 * gap in the feed. That is the failure `live-sibling-channel.spec.ts` exists to prevent — but that spec
 * constructs `LiveStream` directly with an explicit channel, so it cannot see a value lost upstream of
 * it. Observed on real hardware: two cameras on one station, 54 frames tagged channel 0 and 3 tagged
 * channel 4, and both handles delivered all 57.
 *
 * `record` already has this cover in `media-opts-plumbing.spec.ts`. The live leg did not, which is the
 * leg where the filter lives.
