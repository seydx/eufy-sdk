/**
 * An attached stream the station stopped serving re-asserts its channel, once its media has actually stopped.
 *
 * The 3 s re-assert is settled by the first own-channel frame, because one session serving one camera at a
 * time is re-tasked by every re-assert: two attached streams sharing one and doing it continuously contend
 * forever — measured as a
 * full start every 3 s from each, and settling it is what let both hold a 40 s stream.
 *
 * Settling it for the stream's whole life left nothing to recover a stream the station later gave to a
 * sibling: frames stop, no error is raised, no `stop` is emitted, and the consumer starves for as long as it
 * waits. The warm-up watch that would have caught it was cleared by the first frame.
 *
 * So the settle holds only while media keeps arriving. Silence for the stall window re-arms the re-assert, and
 * the next own-channel frame settles it again — the contention is avoided exactly while it would be harmful.
