/**
 * A station serves several cameras at once, one connection each.
 *
 * ONE session serves one camera: a station answers the most recent start on a session, so two cameras sharing
 * one take it from each other in turn — measured on a base carrying three attached cameras, all three
 * receiving their media in bursts. What that measures is the tunnel, not the hardware. Given a session each,
 * the same base holds every camera at full rate: measured on two attached cameras, one at 3840x2160, both at
 * ~15 fps for the length of the run, where the same pair down one session could only take turns.
 *
 * So a camera asked for while its station is already serving another is admitted on a connection of its own,
 * and the cases below pin which camera lands where. The station's own session stays the one that carries its
 * control traffic and its events, because a station announces those to every client that connects and a
 * second announced connection would report all of them twice.
