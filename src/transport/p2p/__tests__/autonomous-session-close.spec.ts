/**
 * What happens to a live source when the session under it goes away UNASKED.
 *
 * A `SharedLiveSource` never holds its own session — the router captures one in a cell when the source is
 * built and never re-resolves it. So a source left cached past its session is handed to the next viewer
 * over a dead connection: it answers the retained keyframe and then fails on the warm-up deadline, which
 * is indistinguishable from a camera that has stopped working.
 *
 * The session's own `close` handler drops the source, but it is guarded on the session still being the
 * station's registered one — and the manager discards the entry BEFORE awaiting the teardown, so on every
 * close the manager itself initiated the guard is already false and the handler does nothing. That is the
 * gap: an idle-detach and a deferred reset are closes with no caller to clean up after them.
 *
 * The router therefore also tears down on {@link SessionManagerOpts.onAutoClose}. A close a CALLER made is
 * deliberately NOT routed there, because `closeAll` disposes its own sources and
 * `replaceUnreachableSession` keeps its source on purpose to rewarm it on the replacement.
