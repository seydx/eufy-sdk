/**
 * A camera attached to a station receives its own media and nothing else, unconditionally.
 *
 * A station fans several cameras out over one session and tags every media frame with the camera it belongs
 * to, so each stream matches its own channel. That match used to have an escape hatch: after enough frames
 * tagged for another camera with none of its own, a stream concluded the station was tagging wrongly and took
 * every frame from then on.
 *
 * The hatch cannot be made safe here. One session serving one camera at a time keeps serving the previous one
 * while a new start is in flight, so a camera opened after another is routinely handed nothing but its
 * sibling's frames to begin with — and a stream that gave up then adopted that sibling's video and audio for
 * the rest of its life. Every attempt to qualify the condition left a hole: keying it on whether a sibling had
 * a start outstanding failed the moment the sibling's pull was released, because the frames already in flight
 * then belonged to a channel nothing had started.
 *
 * What the hatch protected against was a station that tags an attached camera's frames with a channel other
 * than the one started, which would leave the stream delivering nothing. That is DETECTABLE — the warm-up
 * deadline raises a typed start failure naming it — while serving another camera's picture is silent, and for
 * a security camera it is the worse of the two by a wide margin.
