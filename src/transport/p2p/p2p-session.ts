 * talking to a camera: 20 of 53 frames needed a retransmit (38% loss), acknowledgement latency ran
 * 7/57/660 ms (min/median/max), and the app kept at most 7 frames unacknowledged at once.
 *
 * Recovery mirrors that measurement: a frame still unacknowledged after {@link AUDIO_RETRANSMIT_MS} is
 * sent **once** more and then forgotten. Three properties are load-bearing, each verified against a
 * real camera:
 *  - The timeout sits ABOVE the slowest acknowledgement the device is known to take (660 ms). Repeating
 *    a frame that was merely slow doubles the send rate, which delays acknowledgements further; the
 *    resulting spiral collapses the whole session — video included — within seconds.
 *  - A frame is repeated at most once. Repeating until some deadline amplifies traffic roughly 20× and
 *    causes more loss than it repairs.
 *  - Pacing never waits on the outstanding count. The device plays a continuous stream, so throttling
 *    the feed to let acknowledgements catch up starves it far faster than loss does.
 *
 * Abandoning a frame after that one repeat is a deliberate trade against the alternatives above, but it
 * does leave a permanent hole in an ordered stream — which by the ordering property means playback can
 * stop dead there. That is not something to hide behind a bounded map: the frame is dropped AND an
