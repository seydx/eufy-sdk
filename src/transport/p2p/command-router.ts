   * Open a {@link Talkback} on a device's camera channel.
   *
   * **The camera only plays host audio while its media session is open** — verified live on three
   * cameras: the identical start + audio frames produce silence with no media session and audible
   * playback with one. So this attaches a consumer to the shared live source and holds it for the
   * talkback's lifetime, releasing it on stop. The source is shared and refcounted, so an already-open
   * stream costs nothing extra and a talkback on an otherwise idle camera opens the session it needs
   * instead of playing into silence.
   *
   * The level-2 key is waited for softly: only the HomeBase-attached path requires it, and
   * {@link Talkback.start} reports that failure precisely, so a hard wait here would reject an
   * own-session camera that legitimately never negotiates one.
   *
   * Both of the media consumer's events are forwarded rather than left to default. An unhandled
   * `error` on it would take the host process down, and a warm-up failure is exactly the condition
   * that makes talkback silent, so it reaches the caller when one is listening and the log otherwise.
   * A `budget` notice means a battery camera's session is about to auto-stop and take the audio with
   * it mid-sentence; forwarding it lets a caller extend, while ignoring it stops on schedule and
   * protects the battery. The budget belongs to the shared source rather than to one consumer, so a
   * single `extend()` covers a live stream and a talkback running side by side.
   *
   * `stop` ends the talkback with it. The media session going away is the one condition under which
   * audio cannot be heard no matter how well it is framed, so pacing on into a dead session would be
   * silent failure rather than a shorter clip.
   *
   * **One talkback per camera at a time.** Unlike a live pull, this path cannot be fanned out: both
   * handles would pace onto one session's single audio sequence, interleaving two AAC streams into
   * something unplayable, and whichever stopped first would close the device's path under the other —
   * with no error on either side. The second caller is refused rather than handed the first one's
   * handle, which would silently discard its `encoder` and hand it a clip already in progress.
   *
   * The refusal is decided and RECORDED in one synchronous step, before the shared media source is awaited.
   * Warming that source is a round-trip, so two concurrent callers would otherwise both find the map empty,
   * both build a talkback, and the second would overwrite the first in the map — two paced streams on the one
   * audio sequence, and the orphaned handle no longer reachable by {@link P2PCommandRouter.closeAll}. The
   * entry is therefore claimed by the talkback itself, which the media consumer is wired into once it exists;
   * a failure to warm or to open the audio path releases the claim.
   *
   * The claim is re-checked after the wait for the mirror case: a station close or `closeAll` in that window
   * stops the talkback that is holding it, and starting the pacing tick on a stopped talkback would pace into
   * a session nobody is listening on.

   * `onActive`/`onIdle` so an attached stream counts as a user of the station's P2P session (cancels
   * the session idle-detach while streaming; its longer idle timer arms when the last consumer leaves).
   *
   * A source that has **stopped** (linger teardown, failed start, budget auto-stop, upstream error) is

   * being protected by keeping it — and keeping it would leave the options of whichever egress created
   * it first in force for the process lifetime, so a stray `powered` from the day's first snapshot would
   * still be dictating the budget hours later. Dropping it lets the next caller build a fresh source
   * from its own options.
   *
   * Attachment count is deliberately NOT part of that test. A failed start fails its consumers without
   * detaching them, so a caller still holding its handle leaves the count non-zero — and requiring an
   * empty source here would hand one dead source out for the life of the client. A caller must
   * re-acquire through this method after a failure; `attach()` on the dropped source throws, because it
   * has been disposed.
   *
   * Several cameras behind one station each get their own source: the station tags every media frame with the
   * camera it belongs to, and {@link LiveStream} takes only its own.
   *
   * Whether they can be SERVED at the same time is the station's business, not this map's. Where it serves one
   * camera at a time, a pull still lingering for a camera nobody is watching would go on re-issuing its own
   * media start against the one being asked for, so opening a new channel releases those first — see
   * {@link releaseLingeringSiblings}. A pull with consumers is never touched. The release runs before the
   * reuse branch, so a reuse frees the station as a cold start does.
   *
   * `mayOpenOwnSession` decides whether a camera that finds the station's own session claimed may open a
   * connection of its own for it. Only the continuous-pull egresses pass it. A still must not: it wants one
   * frame, and a socket plus a level-2 negotiation per thumbnail is a cost a tile refresh cannot justify —
   * so a still asked for while a sibling is being watched contends as it always did, and the caller's
   * retained image answers it. A live view still outranks a tile; what changed is that two live views no
   * longer have to outrank each other.

   * looking at competing with one somebody just asked for.
   *
   * An `idle` source is skipped, because it is not a linger and holds nothing: it has never warmed, so it
   * has sent no media start and is competing for nothing. Without that, two cameras opened at the same
   * moment destroy each other — the second finds the first's source built but not yet attached to, reads
   * zero consumers as a linger, and disposes the source its caller is holding. Which is the four-tile case

   * it would close a socket and throw away the cheap re-attach the linger exists to provide, to relieve a
   * competition that is not happening.
   *
   * A snapshot tile is nobody looking. Opening a live view in the Home app takes that cell fullscreen, so the
   * pulls refreshing the other cells are off screen, yet each goes on re-issuing its own media start every
   * retry tick — measured as four pulls warming together off one HomeBase, a live request landing 1.4 s later,
   * and the live consumer receiving nothing beyond the retained keyframe until its deadline fired. So a live
   * request also takes the channel from a sibling held only by snapshots, while a snapshot request takes
