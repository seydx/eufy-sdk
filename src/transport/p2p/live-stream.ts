 * Two video frame variants are handled:

 *    those frames are skipped (no key → no video).
 *
 * Emits: `video` ({@link LiveVideoFrame} — Annex-B), `audio` ({@link LiveAudioFrame}), `start`, `stop`,

 * Which cameras need it does **not** follow topology or power source, so there is no predicate to gate

 * covers the one that fails.
 *
 * What the nudge costs differs by topology, and only one branch is a true keepalive: an own-session
 * camera's `startLiveMedia` tracks that the stream is already started and sends the small ping, while a
 * HomeBase-attached camera has no such state and re-sends the full media start — a genuine restart on
 * that path.

 * That restart is harmless on a station serving ONE camera and harmful on a station serving several: it
 * re-asserts this camera's channel every interval, so two attached streams contend continuously. Measured on
 * a real base as a full start every 3 s from each. So an attached stream stops nudging as soon as the station
 * delivers a frame of its own channel — see the private `settleKeepalive`. The measurement that justifies it
