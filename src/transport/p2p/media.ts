/**
 * **Record** a clip — collect the live H.264/H.265 stream for `seconds` and mux it to a fragmented
 * MP4 (same source as {@link captureSnapshotFromShared}, kept running and written to a container).
 * Recording starts at the first complete keyframe so the clip is seekable. Requires `ffmpeg`.
 *
 * Opens its OWN {@link LiveStream} over the session rather than joining the device's shared source, so it
 * costs a second pull on a camera already streaming, and the shared path's release of a sibling's lingering
 * pull does not reach it. `recordFragments` is the shared-consumer path.
 *
 * The clip therefore starts at the SECOND keyframe, so parameter sets announced only with the first are
 * dropped along with it — every frame is watched for an announcement, including the skipped ones, and
 * the collected run is primed before muxing. This also settles the codec, which is sniffed from a config NAL:
 * a run of bare slices would otherwise fall back to H.264 and mislabel an H.265 clip.
 *
 * **Bounded in both phases, so it always settles.** The first phase is bounded by `timeoutMs` waiting for the
 * keyframe the clip starts at; the second is bounded by the clip's own window, which is armed as a deadline
 * the moment capture starts rather than being read off the next frame to arrive. A camera that goes quiet
 * mid-clip delivers no further frame to compare a clock against — measured on an own-session camera that
 * stopped 13.6 s into a stream with no `stop` and no `error` — so a clip whose end is decided inside a frame
 * handler has no end at all, and the promise stays pending for the life of the process. The deadline answers
 * with the run collected up to it: the window the caller asked for has elapsed, and frames the camera never
 * sent cannot be waited into existence.
 *
 * A pull whose SESSION goes away before that window elapses fails the clip instead, naming the close. No
 * further frame can arrive on it, so there is nothing left to wait for, and a caller that asked for a clip of
 * a stated length is told the session went away rather than handed a fragment as if it were the clip. A decode
 * failure on the stream fails it the same way.
 *
 * The `error` listener outlives the collection deliberately. An unhandled `error` on an emitter takes the host
 * process down, and the stream is stopped only after the promise settles, so it stays attached and a late
 * failure lands on an already-settled promise as the no-op it is.

 * A camera commonly announces SPS/PPS ONCE, with the first keyframe of a stream. A snapshot skips that
 * first (often partial) IDR by default and a consumer joining a warm source never sees it at all, so a
 * collected burst routinely begins after the only announcement. A decoder with no SPS/PPS for its first

 * image depends on where in the stream it happened to land. Re-emitting the sets makes it independent of
 * that.
 *
 * Primes unconditionally rather than only when the burst looks incomplete. Re-announcing a set a decoder
 * already holds is harmless — it overwrites the entry with the same id — while judging completeness is
 * not: a unit carrying an SPS but no PPS, or H.265 SPS+PPS but no VPS, reads as self-contained by any
 * cheap test and is precisely a burst that cannot decode alone.
 *
 * `codec` guards the one substitution that would be worse than none: sets from a different codec are
 * parameter sets the burst's decoder cannot use. Without sets, or on a mismatch, the burst passes through
 * unchanged so it fails with the decoder's own reason rather than a fabricated one.
