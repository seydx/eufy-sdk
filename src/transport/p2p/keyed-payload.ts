/**
 * Keyed-payload envelope — the `SET_PAYLOAD` (1350) shape the classic Wi-Fi smart lock takes for its
 * actuation. There is no session key: every command carries its OWN fresh AES-128 key, sealed for the
 * device's long-lived P-256 public key (published by the cloud, one per device), and the inner JSON is
 * AES-128-CBC/PKCS#7 under that key. This module builds the two sealed fields; `P2PSession.sendSetPayload`
 * wraps them in the ordinary envelope and carries a keyed one in the clear, as the vendor app sends it.
 *
 * ## Wire
 *
 * ```
 *   { key: <keyBlobHex>, account_id: <adminUserId>, cmd: <opcode>, mChannel: <ch>, mValue3: 0,
 *     payload: <base64(AES-128-CBC(aesKey, iv, innerJson))> }
 * ```
 * `iv` = ASCII(deviceSn) zero-padded/truncated to 16 bytes. `aesKey` = 16 random bytes, spelled as 32
 * UPPERCASE hex characters — the hex SPELLING is what the key blob seals, not the raw bytes.
 *
 * `key` (hex) is the ECIES envelope {@link eciesWrap} produces for the device's public key over that
 * spelling: `compressedEphemeralPub(33) ‖ nonce(16) ‖ sealedKey(48) ‖ hmac(32)`.
 *
 * Inner JSON for the actuation opcode, `P2P_ON_OFF_LOCK` (1961): `{shortUserId, slOperation: 1|0, userId,
 * userName, seq_num}`.
 *
 * ## Answer
 *
 * The device answers every command at once with an int32 result on the `SET_PAYLOAD` echo — `0`
 * accepted, {@link KEYED_PAYLOAD_SEQ_ERROR} when `seq_num` is not above the mark it holds — and, when the
 * command changed its state, about two seconds later with a `NOTIFY_PAYLOAD` whose JSON carries
 * `P2P_QUERY_STATUS_IN_LOCK` (1955) as `cmd`, the result again under `payload.code` and the state reached
 * under `payload.slState` ({@link keyedPayloadReportCode} reads the code of the report stating the state
 * a command drives to). A command it was already in the state of draws the echo alone.
 *
 * A refusal carries a second `NOTIFY_PAYLOAD`, `CMD_DOORLOCK_P2P_SEQ` (1916), whose `payload.seq_num`
 * ({@link keyedPayloadSeqMark}) is the mark the device holds — so a refused command hands back the exact
 * number to resend above, with no searching. The mark lives with the P2P connection: the first keyed
 * command on a new connection is accepted at whatever number it carries.
 *
 * The command ids are {@link CommandType}'s; the inner field names follow a third-party reverse-engineering
 * project, a name source only.
 */

/**
 * The int32 result the device answers a command with when its `seq_num` is not above the mark it holds for
 * the connection. The command is dropped untried, so this is a retry signal rather than a failure: resend
 * above the mark. The refusal publishes that mark in its `CMD_DOORLOCK_P2P_SEQ` (1916) twin
 * ({@link keyedPayloadSeqMark}), so the resend goes to the next number rather than searching for it.
