/**
 * `ff09` frame encoder — the AES-128-CBC framed control protocol shared by every eufy device that
 * takes a lock-style on/off actuation command (currently: the T8531 video smart lock and the T85D0
 * garage door; likely other actuators later — see below).
 *
 * The command bytes are a self-contained `ff09…` frame, NOT a plain param write, and BOTH transports
 * carry the exact same frame:
 *  - **P2P** (`transport/p2p/command-router.ts`, T8531): wrapped in a `SET_PAYLOAD` (1350) envelope
 *    whose inner `cmd` is `TRANSFER_PAYLOAD` (1940) and `payload` = `{apiCommand:6018,
 *    lock_payload:"ff09…", seq_num, time}`.
 *  - **MQTT** (`transport/mqtt/command-router.ts`, standalone/garage families): base64 of the identical
 *    frame under the `trans` field.
 *
 * So cracking the frame solves both — this module builds ONLY the frame, nothing about either
 * envelope, and sits at the transport root (like `ffmpeg.ts`) specifically so neither transport
 * imports the other for it. Named after the wire frame, not the capability: the two current callers
 * both happen to be locks, but nothing here is lock-specific beyond the {@link LOCK_COMMAND_CODE}
 * opcode value itself — a future actuator (e.g. a curtain) reusing this wire would just be a new
 * opcode constant, not a new encoder.
 *
 * ## Wire (verified byte-exact against captured T8531 lock+unlock frames)
 *
 * **Outer frame** (`lockPayload`, hex):
 * ```
 *   ff 09 | size(u16 LE) | 03(versionCode) 00(reserved) 02(dataType) | cmdEnc(u16 BE) | ct… | xorHash(1)
 * ```
 * `size` = total frame length incl. header + xor. `cmdEnc` = `0x4000 | commandCode` (bit 0x4000 =
 * "encrypted payload"). `xorHash` = XOR of every preceding byte.
 *
 * **Inner plaintext** — an incrementing-separator TLV (`0xA1, 0xA2, …`, each `sep | len | bytes`),
 * then **zero-padded to a 16-byte boundary** before AES (the app pads the buffer, so the real PKCS#7
 * block AES adds is a full 0x10 block):
 * ```
 *   A1 04 <time u32 LE>            — freshness stamp
 *   A2 <len> <admin_user_id ASCII> — the lock owner's id (40 hex chars)
 *   A3 01 <lockByte>               — 0 = lock, 1 = unlock
 *   A4 <len> <username ASCII>      — the acting user's display name (email local-part)
 *   A5 <len> <short_user_id bytes> — the acting member's short id (hex→bytes, e.g. "0003")
 * ```
 *
 * **Cipher**: AES-128-CBC + PKCS#7.
 *  - key = `ASCII(admin_user_id[-12:])` (12 B) ‖ `uint32 BE(time)` (4 B) = 16 B.
 *  - iv  = `ASCII(deviceSn)` zero-padded to 16 B (a 16-char SN is used verbatim).
 *  - `time` is the nonce that makes each command's key differ; it is emitted CLEARTEXT in the
 *    envelope `time` field so the lock can re-derive the key. The app computes it as
 *    `floor(unixSec) | floor(random*100)` — the low bits are randomized. We reproduce that:
 *    `keyTime = unixSec | nonce`, and the TLV `A1` stamp carries the un-noised `unixSec`.
 *
 * ## Settings GET/SET (T85D0 garage/lock auto-lock, 2026-07-16 capture — same cipher/frame family)
 *
 * Two more `apiCommand`/`commandCode` pairs on the SAME outer frame + cipher as above, verified
 * byte-exact against a live GET query + a live GET response + two live SET writes (off→on) on a
 * T85D0:
 *  - **GET** (`LOCK_API_COMMAND.GET_SETTINGS` 6016 / `LOCK_COMMAND_CODE.GET_SETTINGS` 53/0x35,
 *    {@link buildFf09QueryFrame}): plaintext is JUST `[A1 time][A2 adminUserId]` — no user-attribution
 *    fields at all (narrower than even `omitUserFields`, which still keeps A3).
 *  - **SET** (`LOCK_API_COMMAND.SET_SETTINGS` 6015 / `LOCK_COMMAND_CODE.SET_SETTINGS` 52/0x34,
 *    {@link buildFf09SettingsFrame}): `[A1 time][A2 adminUserId][A3 1B][A4 1B enable][A5 2B LE delay-
 *    seconds][A6 1B][A7 2B][A8 2B][A9 1B]`. `A3` is the same **setting-type selector** the Rain Mode
 *    compact write uses (see below) — `0x00` selects auto-lock. `A4`-`A8` are now FULLY CONFIRMED
 *    against the app's own JS (`smartLockSetParamsDataParse`'s `case 0`, carved from a live `/proc/mem`
 *    dump, 2026-07-18 — not just a capture-derived guess): `A4`=`isAutoLock`, `A5`=`autoLockTime`
 *    (seconds, LE u16), `A6`=`isSchedule` (bool), `A7`=`scheduleStartTime`, `A8`=`scheduleEndTime`.
 *    `A7`/`A8` are each `[hourByte, minuteByte]` (the app encodes them as `hour.toString(16)‖
 *    minute.toString(16)`, NOT a packed LE u16) — we still treat them as an opaque 2-byte passthrough
 *    (read from a prior GET, written back unchanged), which stays correct either way since we never
 *    interpret their contents, only preserve them. **`A9` is UNRESOLVED, not "confirmed reserved" —
 *    the app's own `case 0` builder writes exactly 5 fields (`A4`-`A8`) and produces no 6th field at
 *    all.** The original capture this encoder was built from showed a 6th real tagged byte
 *    (`0xA9`, value `0x00`) after `A8`; two independent copies of the app's JS (including a newer
 *    15-case build variant) agree there's no `A9` in `case 0`. This is a genuine, unresolved
 *    discrepancy between the captured wire bytes and the decompiled source — not yet re-verified with
 *    a fresh capture. Left as-is in the shipped encoder (still sends `A9=0x00`) since changing it
 *    without a fresh capture risks breaking a live-verified write over an unconfirmed hypothesis; the
 *    device has never rejected the extra field in any live test.
 *  - **The device's `/res` reply to a GET** is NOT a normal command ack: no `mChannel`/`mValue3`/
 *    `apiCommand`/`seq_num`, just `{cmd:1940, payload:{dev_sn, lock_payload, time}}` where `time` is a
 *    **hex string** (not decimal) that equals the keyTime of the GET that triggered it — matched back
 *    to the query to survive interleaved traffic. Its `cmdEnc` has an extra flag bit set vs. a request
 *    (`0x48xx` not `0x40xx`) but decodes with the exact same key/iv derivation. Decrypted plaintext:
 *    a leading `0x00` status byte, then TLV fields using the same `sep|len|bytes` encoding but the
 *    response's OWN independent tag numbering (does not line up positionally with the GET/SET request
 *    TLVs) — our own capture only ever showed `a1..ad` (13 fields, tags `0xa1`-`0xad`), but this is NOT
 *    the auto-lock write's own reply scoped to auto-lock: **a single `GET_SETTINGS` reply is a FLAT
 *    DUMP of the device's ENTIRE settings state**, one field per tag, covering every setting in the
 *    `A3`/setting-type enum below (not just the one being written) — confirmed against
 *    the app's own `smartLockGetParamsDataParse` (2026-07-18, same JS dump as the case-0 finding
 *    above), which explicit-tag-reads (not sequentially, `getByteParam(<tag>)`/`getSecondParam(<tag>)`/
 *    `getTimeParam(<tag>)`) THIRTY-FOUR fields, tags `0xa1` through `0xc2`:
 *
 *    | tag  | field                              | tag  | field                              |

 *
 *    `a6` is `isOneTouchLock`, an entirely different setting, which is why it never moves with
 *    auto-lock's own on/off state — the REAL current-enable-state field is `a1` (our own
 *    `parseFf09SettingsResponse` already parses it correctly; it is simply not READ by
 *    `sendFf09Autolock`/`dispatchFf09Autolock`, which only pull `a2`/`a4`/`a5`). Not yet
 *    wired into any code path — flagged here as a documented opportunity, not a shipped read.
 *    See {@link decryptFf09Frame} + {@link parseFf09SettingsResponse}.
 *  - **Also live-verified on the T8531 over P2P** (2026-07-18): the same GET/SET frame shape, live-
 *    captured off the P2P wire and confirmed byte-identical in structure to the T85D0 capture above
 *    (same key derivation, same TLV layout, `A5`'s captured value there was 120s/"2 min" vs. this
 *    doc's 90s/"1.5 min" — different device, same field semantics). `dev.lock()?.setAutoLock()` driven
 *    end-to-end through the P2P command router against a real T8531, both directions confirmed via the
 *    app UI — not just byte-exact against a capture. See `transport/p2p/command-router.ts`'s
 *    `sendFf09Autolock`.
 *
 * ## Rain Mode (T8531, 2026-07-18 capture — a SECOND, shorter `SET_SETTINGS` shape)
 *
 * Same `apiCommand`/`commandCode` pair as the auto-lock SET above (6015/52), but a genuinely different,
 * SHORTER plaintext — captured live off the P2P wire toggling Rain Mode off→on: `[A1 time]
 * [A2 adminUserId][A3 1B settingId][A4 1B value]`, nothing past `A4` (no `A5`-`A9` at all). `A3` here
 * is NOT the unconfirmed constant from the full-blob write above — it's a setting-id SELECTOR (`0x07`
 * for Rain Mode), making this a compact single-setting write rather than a read-modify-write of a fixed
 * blob. Because it doesn't touch any field besides the one being set, it's a pure blind write — no GET
 * pass needed first. See {@link FF09_SETTING_ID} + {@link buildFf09SettingToggleFrame}. The `A3`
 * selector addresses at least 14 T8531 settings — the app's own decompiled JS
 * (`smartLockSetParamsDataParse`, 2026-07-18) confirmed the id→setting map; `RAIN_MODE` is the only one
 * independently WIRE-CAPTURED so far, and 6 more (one-touch lock/scramble/wifi/enable-log/privacy/
 * one-touch-rear) are wired but THROW "wire unverified" until each clears that bar — see
 * {@link FF09_SETTING_ID} for the full id list.
 * ✅ LIVE-VERIFIED end-to-end (2026-07-18): `dev.lock()?.setRainMode()` driven through the P2P command
 * router against a real T8531, both directions (off→on and on→off) confirmed via the app UI showing
 * the new state afterward — not just byte-exact against a capture. See
 * `transport/p2p/command-router.ts`'s `sendFf09SettingToggle`.
