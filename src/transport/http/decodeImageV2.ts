/**
 * V2 `v2_eufysecurity:` push-thumbnail decoder — keyless.
 *
 * The v2 format is NOT end-to-end encrypted and needs NO key: it is *head-only obfuscation*. Only a
 * fixed JPEG prefix (SOI + APP0 + the two quantization tables + the SOF dimensions + the luma Huffman
 * tables) is encrypted; everything from the standard DC-chrominance Huffman table (`FF C4 00 1F 01`)
 * onward — the chroma DHTs, the SOS and the entire entropy-coded scan — is left as plaintext standard
 * JPEG. So we reconstruct a viewable image by splicing a freshly built standard JPEG header (correct
 * width/height/chroma-subsampling) onto that plaintext tail.
 *
 * Three unknowns live in the encrypted prefix and are recovered from the scan itself:
 *   - chroma subsampling — it decides which Huffman table each block in an MCU is coded with, so the
 *     wrong guess diverges within a few blocks and the right one walks the scan to its last byte;
 *   - the MCU count — what the scan carries, once subsampling is known;
 *   - width and height — an exact factorisation of that MCU count, chosen by row continuity.
 *
 * The camera's quantization tables are lost with that prefix too. They are not guessed: the substitute
 * tables are right up to a scale, and `contrastScale` below measures the scale the picture itself
 * implies and writes it into the DQT — which recovers the camera's own quality factor closely enough
 * that a thumbnail encoded at quality 30 comes back at 31, rather than washed out.
 *
 * Cracked keylessly 2026-06-04; verified against a live V6 production thumbnail (632×472, 4:4:4).
 *
 * @remarks
 * **Why the search reads the scan rather than decoding candidate frames.** "Does the scan fill this
 * frame?" can be asked by splicing a candidate header on and handing it to `jpeg-js`, since the decoder
 * throws on an under-filled frame. That answer is correct and unaffordable: a `jpeg-js` decode churns
 * about a megabyte of typed arrays whatever the frame size, glibc keeps the arenas rather than handing
 * them back, and the question has to be asked of every candidate geometry — tens of megabytes of
 * resident memory per thumbnail, permanently, which is more than an embedded host gives an app in
 * total. Its ENCODER is worse: ~40 MB of RSS on first use, which is what rules out correcting the
 * picture by rewriting pixels.
 *
 * `scanEntropy` answers the same question by Huffman-walking the scan and discarding every coefficient
 * it decodes: no IDCT, no component planes, no output image, one `Int32Array` of MCU count. The
 * three-hypothesis search allocates a few hundred kilobytes and runs in single-digit milliseconds, and
 * `jpeg-js` is left with the one job that needs it — decoding the ONE frame the search settles on. That
 * decode is a measurement, not a rewrite: what comes back is the camera's own scan under a corrected
 * header (see `contrastScale`), never a re-encode.
 *
 * Measured on the committed fixtures: **+0.4 MB of resident memory and 6 ms per thumbnail**, plus about
 * 13 MB and 38 ms once per process for JIT warm-up.
 *
 * Depends on `jpeg-js` (v0.4.x, BSD-3-Clause, pure-JS, **zero transitive dependencies**) for that one
 * probe decode.
