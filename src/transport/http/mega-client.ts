 *
 * The vendor words the same rejection several ways, and only one carries a distinctive code. All of these were
 * observed on one account: {@link EufyCloudErrorCode.SESSION_KICKED} with `"token does not exist because it was
 * kicked out"` when another login displaced it, and the generic `401` with `"token error"` or `"token not

 * serialised detail of rejections that have nothing to do with the credential, and clearing a healthy session
 * on one of those costs a re-2FA.
 *
 * Two properties of the match keep those anchors on their own subject, and
 * `"token = …, gtoken not equal userid error"` — a HEADER fault on a token that is fine, which no re-login can
 * repair — needs both:
 *  - a wildcard cannot cross a comma, so it stays inside the clause its anchor sits in and cannot borrow a
 *    word from the next one;
 *  - `token` matches as a whole word, so `gtoken` — a different header with a different meaning — is not read
 *    as the credential.
 *
 * Both are bounds on the match rather than edits to the message: the echoed credential still carries the
 * anchor for wordings that state their reason beside it (`"token = … expired"`), so removing the echo before
 * matching would lose a real expiry and leave a dead session uncleared.
