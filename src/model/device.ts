/**
 * The single, concrete {@link Device} class.

 * `{ codec, capabilities, properties }` (see `resolveDevice`). Code asks
 * `device.has("light")` / `device.getProperty("battery")` — never `instanceof FloodlightCamera`.
 *
 * Live state is held as a flat map of `PropertyValue`, updated by feeding raw param maps
 * (from the cloud record or P2P notifications) into {@link Device.applyParams}. Params the model
 * doesn't recognise are **not dropped** — they are kept as `unknown_<paramType>` passthrough, so
 * coverage can grow later without losing data today (the graceful-unknown rule, applied to params).

 * Adding a capability adds an accessor here automatically — no edit to this file.
