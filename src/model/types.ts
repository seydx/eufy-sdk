/**
 * Device model — shared contract.
 *
 * The whole model is **data-driven and capability-based**.
 * There is exactly ONE concrete device class; behaviour comes from:
 *
 *  - a **codec** (axis B2 — how commands are framed/routed for a device *family*), and
 *  - a set of composable **capabilities** (axis A — what the device exposes), each of which
 *    contributes a property schema (and, later, command behaviour).
 *
 * A device's `{ codec, capabilities }` is resolved by a 3-tier lookup
 * (exact model row → category default → inference). New SKUs in a known family need no code.
 *
 * This file is the integration contract: every other `src/model/*` module imports from here.
 */

/**
 * Command-codec families (axis B2). One per genuinely-different wire protocol.
 *
 * `station|camera|sensor|lock|keypad` are the eufy **security** families (P2P; param space
 * 1000+). `vacuum` is the eufy **clean** line (RoboVac) — a different transport (Tuya/MQTT
 * data-points) and a different param namespace (DP ids ~150-180), so its params come from a
 * separate authoritative source (`get_product_data_point` → `data_point_list`), NOT the P2P
 * device list. Per-namespace param dictionaries, not one global table.
 *
 * `light` is the eufy **life** smart-lighting line (e.g. T8L02 "Permanent Outdoor Lights") — its
 * own secure-MQTT "DP" TLV wire, decoded by its own transport codec. Named distinctly
 * from the camera-floodlight `light` *capability* so the two never collide as bare `"light"`.
 *
 * `display` is the T87Ax Smart Display line — its own codec because its `device_type` collides with
 * the security residual range (confirmed live, 2026-09-04: it connects over secure MQTT with no
 * `p2p_did`, never P2P). It owns its own param namespace (ids 8001-8006) and its own product line, so
 * no other line's capability can attach to it — see `namespaceForCodec` and `CODEC_LINE`. The `display`
 * capability targets it and reads the charge; no screen/audio/assistant param has been observed, so
 * those are absent rather than deferred.

/**
 * What a value MEANS, as opposed to how it is stored — the semantic annotation that makes a reading
 * convertible without a hardcoded table per property.
 *
 * `PropertyValueType` says a value is a number; this says whether that number is a battery
 * percentage, a temperature, a signal strength, a duration or an instant. The distinction is not
 * cosmetic: a `seconds` duration and a `timestamp` instant are both numbers of seconds, and treating
 * one as the other is wrong in a way no type check catches.
 *
 *  - `boolean` — an on/off state (always paired with `type: "bool"`).
 *  - `percent` / `celsius` / `dbm` / `seconds` / `hours` / `megabytes` / `degrees` — a measured quantity
 *    in the unit the device reports it in; each pairs with the matching `unit`. Values are
 *    never converted on the way out — a converted reading is an invented one. `seconds` and `hours`
 *    are separate kinds for exactly that reason: a robot reports a run in seconds and a consumable's
 *    wear in hours, and normalising one into the other would publish a number the device never sent.
 *  - `scalar` — a plain number in no unit at all: a step on a ladder, a mode index, a raw level, a
 *    segment count. Ordered and comparable, but its range and direction are the device's, so nothing
 *    but the device says what a given value means.
 *  - `bitfield` — a number whose individual bits carry the meaning, not its magnitude.
 *  - `enum` — one of a named set; the set is the property's `enumValues` (raw → label) or, for a value
 *    a read decodes, the read's own `values`.
 *  - `identifier` — an opaque id whose domain lives elsewhere (a cloud-fetched list), so it is not
 *    ordered and not arithmetic.
 *  - `timestamp` — an instant, unix seconds.
 *  - `text` — free-form or structured text with no further promise.
 *
 * Three pairs are close enough to pick wrongly, so the test for each:
 *
 *  - **`scalar` vs a measured quantity** — is there a unit the device reports it in? A sensitivity
 *    step, a mode index and a segment count are all `scalar` precisely because there is none; they
 *    are NOT counts of anything, and the name says only "a bare number". A quantity with a unit takes
 *    the kind naming that unit, and the two are checked against each other in both directions.
 *  - **`identifier` vs `enum`** — can we publish the set? An `enum` ships its options with it, so its
 *    label needs nothing else. An `identifier` is a number whose domain is
 *    held somewhere we do not control (a catalogue the app fetches), so there is no set to ship and
 *    arithmetic on it — ordering, nearest-value, a range — is meaningless.
 *  - **`bitfield` vs `enum`** — one value, or several at once? A bitfield's bits combine, so it has no
 *    single label and its magnitude means nothing. The named bits belong to the capability that
 *    decodes them and are exported beside that decoder; unlike an enum's options they are not carried
 *    here, which is a gap this vocabulary does not close on its own.
