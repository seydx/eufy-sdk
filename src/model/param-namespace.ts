/**
 * Param namespaces — which id space a device's reported `paramType`s live in.
 *
 * The three spaces overlap numerically and mean unrelated things, so a lookup MUST be namespaced: id
 * `163` is `battery` as a vacuum Tuya DP and `lightLength` as a `eufy_life` DP tag. Resolving a param
 * without its namespace is how one product line's state silently reads as another's.
 *
 * This lives outside `param-dictionary.ts` so the namespace union and the dispatch stay one small table
 * a reader can hold at once, next to the guard that a codec resolves to exactly one namespace — rather
 * than at the head of two thousand entries.
 *

 * The param namespace each codec's ids live in — the one place that mapping is made, so the model and
 * the inspector can't disagree about how to read a device's params. Exhaustive over {@link Codec} on
 * purpose: a new codec is a **compile error** here rather than a silent fall-through to `security`
 * (which would read another line's dictionary — e.g. a mower's Tuya DPs decoded as security params,
 * mislabelling the security battery id on a device where it means nothing).
 *
 * `mower` shares the **clean** namespace: it's a Clean-line Tuya-DP device (the app's `TuyaP2PMower`
 * family), so its DPs live in the same `~150-180` space as the vacuums.
 *
 * `display` (the T87Ax Smart Display line) reads its own dictionary for the same reason every other
 * line does: nothing in the 8001-8006 range carries a security meaning, so reading those ids against
 * `SECURITY_PARAMS` would decode a future security param assigned in that range as whatever it means on
 * a camera. The product line in `CODEC_LINE` is the other half — without it, any security capability
 * whose `modelHints` regex matched this device's reported name is inference-attachable, which
 * `line-partition.spec.ts`'s `POISONED` case measures at six on a device that speaks no P2P and can
 * answer for none of them.
