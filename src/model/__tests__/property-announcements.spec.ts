/**
 * What a param application is worth ANNOUNCING — the changed properties a host can be told about, with
 * the value the getter now answers.
 *
 * `applyParams` already returns the property names whose value moved, resolved through the family-gated
 * `specByParam` map with alias promotion, per-model enums and per-id polarity applied. This is the
 * second half: which of those names the SDK will stand behind, and the value beside each.
 *
 * The rules under test are the ones a caller relies on. Only a SCHEMA property is announced, because
 * the schema is what the SDK published and `getProperty` serves every entry — a dictionary-named or
 * `unknown_<pt>` param is a thing the SDK makes no claim about. The value comes out of live state
 * through the SAME narrowing the getter uses, never a second conversion of the wire value, so the
 * payload cannot disagree with the getter beside it. And EVERY schema property is announced: there is no
 * per-member opt-out and no central filter on `kind`.
