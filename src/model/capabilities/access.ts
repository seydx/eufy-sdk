/**
 * Capability param access — the shared surface capability modules use to WRITE a param (the
 * command-intent builders) and to READ one (the typed read extractors at the bottom of this file).
 *
 * **Write:** a capability states *what* to change (param id + already-polarity-resolved value) and,
 * when the firmware pins it, *which wire form* the data takes. It never picks an encryption level or
 * assembles a P2P frame: the transport resolver ({@link module:index} `resolveScalar`) does that,
 * session-first for `"auto"`. Adding or changing a capability = call these helpers; the transport
 * stays untouched.
 *
 * **Read:** the `readNum`/`readBool`/`readStr` extractors narrow a live property to a typed value for
 * the fluent read getters (`dev.battery()?.level`) — the dual of the write builders.
 *
 * @module model/capabilities/access
 * ## `ScalarForm`
 * - `"auto"` — a scalar int whose encryption level the **session** decides: L2 direct-binary when a
 *   level-2 key is negotiated, else L1 int-string. Correct for params that are the same bytes either
 *   way (camera power 1035 — verified live on standalone T8410 = L1 and HomeBase T8114 = L2).
 * - `"int-string"` — force the L1 int+string frame. For params the firmware only accepts as level-1
 *   even on a HomeBase (status LED 1045; the Cam2C/2/3 floodlight switch 1400).
 * - `"direct-binary"` — force the L2 binary "direct" frame (spotlight brightness/color-temp/enable).
 *
 * ({@link ScalarForm} is declared in `./types` to keep the Command union self-contained.)

 * payload}`, GCM signCode 8 — NOT the bare `{commandType,data}` 1700 wrapper `setJson` uses. The wire
 * eufy uses for a few doorbell controls (status-LED 1716 `{light_enable}`). Level-2 by default; the
 * sink resolves the session/account_id and replays the frame.
 *
 * ## When this envelope takes `form: "auto"`
 *
 * Left at the default the frame is level-2 ONLY, and on a station holding no level-2 key that does not
 * fail — it WAITS: the transport spends the full level-2 grace, re-prompts, spends it again, and only
 * then throws. Every caller with a shorter bound sees a hang rather than a refusal, so a control on a
 * device that may be its own keyless station is effectively unreachable. `"auto"` hands the choice to
 * the session (`sendBySessionLevel`), which seals level-2 wherever a key exists — unchanged for a
 * HomeBase — and level-1 where none does.
 *
 * Two conditions, and BOTH have to hold:
 *
 *  1. **`mValue3` is passed explicitly as 0.** The level-1 form of this envelope writes `mValue3:0`
 *     itself, while the level-2 form defaults it to the sub-command — so a command that passes 0 sends
 *     byte-identical JSON either way and `"auto"` only changes the seal. A command that OMITS `mValue3`
 *     would send a DIFFERENT object at level 1 than the one captured at level 2; that is a new wire
 *     needing its own evidence, not a downgrade, and it stays pinned until something captures it.
 *  2. **The device can be its own station.** A camera or doorbell may be standalone; a HomeBase, and an
 *     accessory whose session IS its HomeBase's, always holds a key. Where a key is structurally
 *     guaranteed, staying pinned is the honest behaviour: a keyless station there is an anomaly, and
 *     throwing says so where a silently-ignored level-1 frame would look like success.
