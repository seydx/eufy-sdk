/**
 * `display` — a eufy Smart Display's charge.
 *
 * One typed read, and the smallness is the finding rather than a gap. The captured unit (a T87A0,
 * 2026-09-04) connects over secure MQTT with no `p2p_did`, so it speaks no P2P at all, and it reported
 * six params in an id range no other line uses. Only one of them tells a caller something it could not
 * get another way:
 *
 *  - 8005 and 8006 restate the model's retail name and code, which `info` already answers from the
 *    curated registry and the cloud record. Their evidence IS that agreement, so a getter beside `info`
 *    would offer a caller a second spelling of what it just read. They are named in the display param
 *    dictionary, which is what makes them readable off `getProperties()`.
 *  - 8003 is version-shaped and nothing confirms what it means, so it is `unexposed`: in the schema with
 *    its type and its `guessed` label, reachable through `getProperty`, no typed getter.
 *
 * Nothing is writable. No capture pins a write for any display param, and an AIoT write is
 * fire-and-forget, so a wrong frame to a device that acknowledges nothing looks exactly like success. A
 * screen, a volume, an assistant: the device plainly has all three and reports none of them in anything
 * captured, which means the reads have to arrive before a control can be honest about what it moves.
