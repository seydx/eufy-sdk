/**
 * Cross-module property-id integrity — the general form of the guard the siren fix needed locally.
 *
 * A capability property is a claim that a wire id carries a given meaning. Two ways that claim rots:
 *  1. it points at an id NO param dictionary knows (a `provenance:"guessed"` number nobody has
 *     grounded), so nothing schema-driven ever validates it; or
 *  2. it points at an id ANOTHER capability in the same product line already owns for a different
 *     meaning — the one-owner rule — so a device reports one and both capabilities read it, and one of
 *     them lies (e.g. a pan-tilt cam flipping the image reads back as a tilt angle).
 *
 * The siren fix caught this class for one module; iterating every module catches it everywhere and,
 * crucially, stops a NEW property from joining the debt silently. The pre-existing offenders are
 * enumerated below as explicit, tracked debt — not to bless them, but so any addition beyond this list
 * fails here and forces a conscious decision. Emptying these lists (grounding the ids / repointing the
 * collisions) is follow-up work, some of it needing on-device confirmation.
