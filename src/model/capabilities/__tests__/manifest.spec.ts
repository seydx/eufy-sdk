/**
 * The manifest is the SDK's answer to "what does this device expose" for a caller outside the package,
 * so what it claims has to be true of the object a caller then reaches for. What this locks:
 *
 *  1. an unbound device says so, rather than describing itself as exposing nothing,
 *  2. the described reads are the INSTALLED ones — the evidence gate is observable from outside,
 *  3. enumeration and the member tables agree, so "read the live object" is safe rather than merely
 *     convenient — this is what fails if someone hand-writes a getter in an `actions()` factory,
 *  4. describing a device reads no VALUES: no getter is invoked and nothing observed leaks in,
 *  5. it survives a JSON round-trip, since a host consumes it over a wire it does not share with us,
 *  6. a provider-gated method is described only on a device bound to that provider.
