  // SoloCam proves PT via reported preset params (6090/6091/6092/6210) and a rotate command surface
  // (1029); Indoor-PT (deviceType 31/35/111 + C220 range 10008-10011) reports NO PT param, so the
  // vendor deviceType is the only honest signal; explicit PT/S340/S350 model names also prove it.
  // OUTDOOR_PT_CAMERA (48, e.g. SoloCam S340 / T8170) is pan-tilt by definition but a live unit can
  // report none of the preset params — trust the deviceType. The rotating SoloCam solar variant
  // T8124R shares deviceType 62 with the FIXED T8124 base, so its model code is the only honest
  // signal that separates the two. Match ONLY confirmed rotating model codes here — do NOT widen to
  // a `T81\d\dR` wildcard: the "R = rotating" reading is unverified for other models, and an
  // over-broad hint would false-positive a future non-PT model, the same class of bug as a mislabel.
