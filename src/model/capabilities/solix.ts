/**
 * The `energyMeter` surface — the electrical readings the vendor app names, as typed members. Each is
 * read-only and evidence-gated: `bindMembers` installs a getter only once a frame that REPORTS that tag
 * has landed, and answers `undefined` (not a fabricated `0`) before any has. The gate is "reported", not
 * "non-zero": a single-phase / single-CT meter still reports its L2/L3 slots as `0.0`, so those members
 * install and read `0` rather than staying absent — a caller sees `0` for an idle phase, not `undefined`.
 *
 * Provenance splits by what the evidence actually pins. The app's field VOCABULARY (these twelve names)
 * is authoritative. For the tag→field binding, a live single-phase frame confirmed the L1 and total
 * magnitudes (a nominal mains voltage, an equal line/total power pair, the line current), so those four
 * positions are `verified`. The L2/L3 tags are never non-zero on a single-CT install and the app itself
 * receives the meter as named JSON — there is no tag→phase decoder in the app binary — so their phase
 * assignment is inferred from the block ordering and is marked `guessed`, not `apk`. The energy counters (`meterImportEnergy`/`meterExportEnergy`) are named
 * on the wire but are NOT members here: their tag→name is confirmed, but their unit SCALE is not (a live
 * reading is consistent with either Wh or kWh), so they stay raw named values via
 * {@link SOLIX_METER_FIELD_NAMES} until a capture pins the scale, rather than ship a member with a guessed unit.
 *
 * @internal — the declaration `SolixEnergyMeterReads` derives from; exported (like the eufy `*_MEMBERS`
 * tables) so it is a known symbol, but excluded from the rendered API reference.
