   * The inverse of {@link readAliases}, which is one value across several wire ids. This is several
   * values inside ONE wire id, which is how the clean line reports most of what it knows: nine
   * consumable counters arrive as nine sub-messages of a single `ConsumableRuntime` on DP 168, and a
   * `CleanParam` on DP 154 carries the carpet strategy and the clean type together.
   *
   * **Two shapes, by whether the member also declares a `param` of its own.**
   *
   * *Derived only* (no `param`): the member contributes NO {@link PropertySpec}. The schema describes
   * what a device REPORTS and the device reports one DP, so a second spec for that id would give
   * `Device` two names for one param — and it stores under only the first, leaving the extra getters
   * answering `undefined` forever. That is exactly the failure the evidence gate exists to prevent.
   *
   * *Second source* (with a `param`): the member keeps its own wire and its own spec, and reaches into
   * the owner's payload only on a device that did not report that wire. This is what lets ONE property
   * span both clean lines when the two report it differently — the legacy Tuya line puts the lifetime
   * cleaned area on its own DP, the AIoT line buries it inside `CleanStatistics` on DP 167. Without it,
   * the same value would need two names and every host would branch on device family to ask for it.
   * The `decode` sees whichever raw value the device actually has, so it discriminates on SHAPE, the way
   * the clean line's cross-family decoders already do.
   *
   * **Watch what the owner was installed BY.** An owner with {@link readAliases} can be present because
   * of an alias, and the value stored under its property is then the ALIAS's — a different wire carrying
   * a different figure. A borrowing member that cannot come from that wire has to screen for it, either
   * with its own {@link available} gate or in its `decode`; `lifetimeCleanCount` does both.
   *
   * Read-only either way. Setting a field inside a shared payload means re-encoding the whole message,
   * which needs an encoder and a captured write this SDK does not have; the owner keeps that wire.
   * Guarded by `property-id-integrity.spec.ts`.
   *
   * **Naming an owner in ANOTHER capability.** A string names a sibling in this table, which covers
   * every payload whose readings all belong to one capability. Some do not: `DeviceInfo` on DP 169
   * carries the robot's MAC, SSID and IP beside the DOCK's firmware version, and the one-owner rule is
   * per product LINE — so one capability must own that id and the other's reading would otherwise have
   * to hang off the wrong object. The `{ property, param }` form says "read the property another module
   * owns, gated on the param that carries it", which works because `Device` keys state by NAME in one
   * flat namespace shared across capabilities. Both halves are stated rather than looked up: a member
