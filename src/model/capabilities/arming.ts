   * channel in or out of an existing list isn't possible without risking clobbering the rest — so
   * this ships as a caller-supplies-everything write instead of guessing a merge.

 * `geo` 47 — the five that had no capture behind them, each sent as exactly this frame and each observed
 * to bring MODE_SWITCH back. That observation is the evidence rather than an inference from it: the client
 * emits `armingModeChanged` only once its own bounded readback has CONVERGED on the mode asked for, so a
 * station that ignored the write would have produced silence instead.
