 * {@link notMainsCamera}, so they don't sprout a bogus battery %, a cell temperature, a state of
 * health or a solar harvest.
 *
 * Which reads those are is {@link CELL_PARAMS}, and {@link cellGated} applies this from it. The settings
 * beside them are deliberately NOT gated, and that split is the whole reason the capability stays
 * attached.
 *
 * **It FAILS OPEN.** A record carrying no `model` matches no prefix, so every cell read is published —
 * the same shape as any model this list does not name. That is the safer direction of the two (a real
 * battery camera never silently loses its charge) and it is why the list can only ever be a floor: a
 * device whose record is thin still shows the sentinels. A spec pins it so the behaviour is chosen
 * rather than inherited.
 *
 * It is also a STATIC fact about a model, not a live reading of what is powering the device. Nothing
 * here handles a unit whose supply can change — a camera moved onto a battery base, say. Moot for these
 * three, which have no cell to charge, and stated because the shape of the guard does not say so.
 *
 * An explicit list, NOT a `device-family.ts` predicate (`isFloodLight`/`isIndoorCamera`): composing
 * those would over-reach — not every floodlight or indoor cam is mains-only, and this must assert mains
 * only for hardware actually checked. `WORKING_MODE_DEFAULT_MODELS` in this file is the same shape.
 * Evidence bars differ: T8425 (Floodlight Cam) is confirmed on owned hardware; T8419 (Indoor Cam) is
 * taken from the app's own mains-cam handling (see the note on `publishedWorkingModeDomain`); T8410
 * (Indoor Cam Pan & Tilt) is confirmed mains-only by the maintainer, reported after a live unit showed
 * a battery level, a cell temperature and both solar reads it cannot have.
 *
 * KNOWN, ACCEPTED trade: because the capability stays, `poweredOf` (camera.ts) still resolves these as
 * `battery`, so a live stream is budgeted as if cell-powered. An unnecessary power budget is cheap; a
 * phantom battery icon is a support ticket — so the visible entity is fixed here and the budget is
 * left as-is (a `poweredOf` refinement would be a separate change).

 *  - `powerSource` (1293) is the open one. Both values it names — `Battery` and `External Solar Panel` —

 *    every param above is one a live mains camera was observed to publish and 1293 was not among them,
 *    and because it is `requires`-gated on its own param, so it appears only where the device reports
