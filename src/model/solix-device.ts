/**
 * A capability-driven model for a discovered Anker Solix device — the Solix analogue of the eufy
 * `Device` model: ONE `SolixDevice` class, no per-model subclasses, and behaviour resolved from what
 * the device reports (its catalog category + record fields + live telemetry) rather than switched on
 * its model. Callers branch on {@link SolixDevice.has}(capability), never on the product code.
 *
 * `energyMeter()`'s reads come from the shared `members` engine ({@link SOLIX_ENERGY_METER_MEMBERS} +
 * `bindMembers`) and are evidence-gated, so a getter exists only once a live frame has carried its tag.
 * `identity` / `firmware` / `connectivity` are read-only projections of the device record, so they take
 * no telemetry and are answerable whenever the record carries the field.
