/**
 * Device registry + the **3-tier resolver**.
 *
 * Resolving a {@link CloudRecord} to a {@link ResolvedDevice} (`{ codec, capabilities,
 * properties, name }`) is the heart of the data-driven model. Most-specific wins, but the
 * result is always *additive* so nothing is ever lost:
 *
 *  1. **model row** (curated, tier 1) — a hand-authored {@link RegistryEntry} keyed by T-code.
 *     Best naming + curated extra capabilities. Optional; most devices never need one.
 *  2. **category default** (tier 2) — {@link classify} maps the cloud `device_type` (or, failing
 *     that, the model code) to a {@link Codec}, which contributes its baseline capabilities.
 *  3. **inference** (tier 3) — {@link detectCapabilities} adds whatever the device can *prove*
 *     about itself from its reported params + model/category strings (graceful unknown).
 *
 * The final capability set is the union of all three tiers (deduped), minus the ones a module marks
 * {@link import("./capabilities/types").CapabilityModule.ownedByStation} when the record says this
 * device hangs off a parent — the one place the result is subtractive, because a control the group's
 * owner holds is one this device cannot answer for however it was granted. `source` records the most
 * authoritative tier that fired, for diagnostics.
 *
 * The curated rows below are intentionally a **small seed** — the system classifies and works
 * read-only for devices with no row at all. Rows exist only to add curation (pretty names,
 * capabilities not provable from params alone). They are the place to encode model-specific
 * knowledge as it is *confirmed* (via the APK / a mega query) — never as a dumping ground.
