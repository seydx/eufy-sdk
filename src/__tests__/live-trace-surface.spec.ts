/**
 * The live-trace vocabulary is reachable from the package entry point.
 *
 * `live-trace.ts` instructs a caller to match on the message plus a phase to tell one startup outcome from
 * another, and both reach the root through `export *` hops rather than being named there — so nothing about
 * the entry point itself shows that they arrive, and a reader looking for them in its declaration file
 * finds four `export *` lines.
 *
 * A caller's own phase allowlist has to be typed against the union to survive it widening: the SDK adds a
 * phase without needing consumer coordination, so a hand-copied list compiles and passes its own tests
 * while discarding the new one. `satisfies Record<LiveTrace["phase"], true>` is the form that fails
 * instead, and this pins that it is available.
 *
 * Imported through `../index.js` deliberately, so removing a hop fails here rather than after release.
