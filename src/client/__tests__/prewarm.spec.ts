/**
 * Speculative pre-warm is **opt-in**, and these specs pin why.
 *
 * Pre-warm opens a station's P2P session on an event nobody asked for, and a session heartbeats the
 * device it is open to. Wired stations are warmed at login and never idle-detach, and an attached
 * camera's session lives on its wired base — so the only station a pre-warm can actually open is a
 * standalone battery camera, the one device class the on-demand session lifecycle exists to let sleep.
 * A default that pre-warms therefore spends battery on every host that never asked for the feature,
 * which is why the event list starts empty and a caller opts in per event, and may further restrict
 * which power tiers it applies to.
 *
 * The policy is exercised through the private seam the push handler calls, with the registry seeded so
 * the station key and its power tier resolve through the real code rather than a stub.
